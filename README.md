Let's cheat and appriximate pi by counting the pixels inside a circle

drawing en red circle 10000 pixels in diameter into a black square of 10000 pixels side
and multiplying the ratio red / total pixels by 4

PI :
 1200x 1200 pixels : 3.13605
10000x10000 pixels : 3.14160188

Which is a very poor approximation of PI
Thats not a good method :-)
